CS4310 Project 3 - Prioritize It

Team Members:
Tim Hsieh - Prioritized implementing renice
Fionna Quach - Prioritized adding priority levels and implementing -l to ps
Ryan Andrada - Prioritized implementing linear queue for priority scheduling

This project features additional functionality for the ps command, as well as altering
the priority levels of running processes, thus affecting the order in which they are
executed. The changing of priority levels is achieved through a basic linear ready
queue and the resulting change can be viewed via running: ps-l after running renice.
